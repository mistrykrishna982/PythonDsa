Roll No. 30- Index 29
Since every student has a fixed slot (index), the teacher can directly go to any student's attendance without checking the previous records.
For example:
If the teacher wants to mark the attendance of Roll No. 16, they can directly access index 15.
There is no need to search from Roll No. 1 to Roll No. 16
This is called direct (random) access, which is the most important feature of an array
